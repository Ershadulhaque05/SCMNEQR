Title: A NOVEL STATE CONNECTION STRATEGY FOR QUANTUM COMPUTING TO REPRESENT AND COMPRESS DIGITAL IMAGES

Abstract- Quantum image processing draws a lot of attention due to
faster data computation and storage compared to classical
data processing systems. Converting classical image data
into the quantum domain and state label preparation complexity
is still a challenging issue. The existing techniques
normally connect the pixel values and the state position directly.
Recently, the EFRQI (efficient flexible representation
of the quantum image) approach uses an auxiliary qubit that
connects the pixel-representing qubits to the state position
qubits via Toffoli gates to reduce state connection. Due to
the twice use of Toffoli gates for each pixel connection still
it requires a significant number of bits to connect each pixel
value. In this paper, we propose a new SCMFRQI (state
connection modification FRQI) approach for further reducing
the required bits by modifying the state connection using a
reset gate rather than repeating the use of the same Toffoli
gate connection as a reset gate. Moreover, unlike other existing
methods, we compress images using block-level for
further reduction of required qubits. The experimental results
confirm that the proposed method outperforms the existing
methods in terms of both image representation and compression
points of view.
